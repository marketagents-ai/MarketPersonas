      "description": "Now we have some questions about different groups in our society.  Here is a seven-point scale on which the characteristics of people in a group can be rated.  In the first statement a score of 1 means that you think almost all of the people in that group are 'rich.'  A score of 7 means that you think almost all of the people in the group are 'poor.'  A score of 4 means that you think that the group is not towards one end or another, and of course you may choose any number in between that comes closest to where you think people in the group stand. Where would you rate Whites in general on this scale?",
